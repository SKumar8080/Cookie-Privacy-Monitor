## 🌟 Features

### Real-time Cookie Monitoring
- Continuously track cookies being set by visited websites
- Identify suspicious patterns (unusually long expiry, excessive size, hidden tracking identifiers)
- Live dashboard with comprehensive cookie analytics

### Advanced Detection Engine
- **Third-party Cookie Detection**: Flag cookies from unrelated domains and known trackers
- **Risk Scoring**: Intelligent risk assessment (low, medium, high) for each cookie
- **Tracker Database**: Built-in detection of advertising, fingerprinting, and tracking networks

### Privacy Controls
- **One-Click Cleanup**: Clear specific cookies or categories (trackers, third-party, expired)
- **Sandbox Isolation**: Prevent selected sites from sharing cookies with others
- **Selective Protection**: Opt-in/opt-out per feature with granular control

### Professional Dashboard
- Categorized cookie activity display
- Detailed metadata: domain, path, creation time, expiry, security flags
- User-friendly interface designed for both technical and non-technical users
